# FederalInnovations

This repository contains a simple web page demonstration using [three.js](https://threejs.org/) to render an animated wave background. The page includes a fixed navigation bar and responsive styling.

## Usage

Simply open `index.html` in a modern web browser. The page fetches the required modules from a CDN, so no build or installation steps are necessary.

Mouse movement influences the animation, causing waves to react in real time. Navigation links are placeholders that can be updated for your specific content.

## Repository Layout

- `index.html` – The main HTML file defining the page layout, styles, and wave background script.
- `README.md` – This file.

Feel free to modify the HTML and CSS to fit your needs or extend the script for additional effects.
